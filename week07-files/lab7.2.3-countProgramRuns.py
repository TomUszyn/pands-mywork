# lab7.2.3-countProgramRuns.py
# Write a program that counts how many times it was run.
# For this exercise will have to store data outside of memory, and that is accessible
# each time the program is run, (persistent data). We would normally use a
# database for something like this, but we can use a file.
# To make life easier letâ€™s assume that the file already exists. So, we can just read
# the current count from it then overwrite it with the new count.
# Create a file called count.txt and put in 0 into it
