# pands-mywork

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my progress and skills in programming and scripting using Python.

## Description

In this repository, you will find scripts that demonstrate my abilities in Python programming. Each projectfolder is designed to highlight different aspects of programming and scripting, covering a wide range of topics and techniques.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `week1`: Introduction. Actually this is not a directory. I just setting up environment such as VS Code, Git and GitHub and Anaconda.
- `week2`: Statements. This topic cover what program is and write a simple code.
- `week3`: Variables. This topic cover the different types of variables, sample of the Math module and basic strings    manipulating.
- `week4`: Controlling the flow. This topic cover if statements and while and for loops.
- `week5`: Data. This topic cover lists, tumples and directories.
- `week6`: Functions. This topic cover functions and modules. thos should give idea how to break longer program into functrions.
- `week7`: Files. This topic cover reading and writhing files. There is also introduction to JSON and CSV files.
- `week8`: Mathplotlib. This topic cover introduction to numpy and mathplotlib.
- `week9`: Errors. This topic cover eroors and exceptions, testing and logging.


Feel free to explore each directory to learn more about the programs and scripts I have worked on. Programs have names suggesting what for they are created.
